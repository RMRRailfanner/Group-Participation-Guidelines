We are building our community: a space for people to experience and learn about the railfanning hobby and we are a global community on this journey together, and we want to ensure everyone feels welcome and safe and is treated with kindness and respect in our community. That’s why we’ve created these Community Standards: to outline how we expect our members to behave, and to be clear up front about what is and isn’t allowed in our community.

Our Community Standards are organized into five sections:

* Safety
* Civility and Respect
* Fairness and Transparency
* Security and Privacy
* Misusing Group Features

These standards apply to all of your actions in our community and with other members. We ask that you respect our standards — and understand that violating them may result in temporary or permanent suspensions from our community.. We’re always learning, so as our community evolves and grows, these Community Standards may also change.

We appreciate your cooperation with these rules and commitment to making our community a safe and respectful space for everyone.
